    <h1> YOUR WILL <br>YOUR WAY</h1>
     <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
     <p>A Terms & Conditions agreement dictates the rules, restrictions, obligations, and responsibilities while playing your game.

        A Terms & Conditions agreement can include:
        
        Standards of behavior if your game allows for users to interact with other users
        Payment terms if you charge for the game
        Liability disclaimers that may arise from playing your game
        Many other useful clauses
        Examples of the above:
        
        Fingersoft, a game developer in Finland, combines licensing terms and rules of use into a Terms of Service/End User License Agreement hybrid.
        Take2Games provides one Terms & Conditions that applies to all of its games.
        Niantic Labs, known for their augmented reality games, creates separate Terms & Conditions agreements for each game. Pokemon Go has a different agreement than Ingress, even though they are both produced by Niantic Labs.
        Whether you maintain a general Terms & Conditions agreement or separate agreements for different games depends on how different your games are from one another.
        
        For example, if one of your games is made only for adults over 18 but another one targets children under 13, you're likely better off writing separate Terms & Conditions agreements.
        
        However, if the differences between your games are very subtle, e.g. one game is a subscription service and the other is free with in-app purchases, you can cover both in one Terms & Conditions agreement.</p>
